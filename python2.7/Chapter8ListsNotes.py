>>> a = 'banana'
>>> b = 'banana'
>>> a is b
True
Python only created one string object, and both a and b refer to it.

But when creating 2 list, you get 2 objects.
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a is b
False
the two lists are equivalent, because they have the
same elements, but not identical, cuz not same objects. 
Same values, different objects.

If identical, then equivalent, yet converse isn't necesarily true.


>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> b is a
True
If a refers to an object, and you assign b = a, then both variables refer to same object


reference: the association of a variable with an object
When an object has more than one name, it is aliased.
Changes made to one alias affects the other if the obejct is mutable.
>>> b[0] = 17
>>> print a
[17, 2, 3]
Avoid aliasing when working with mutable objects.

append method modifies a list, but the +
operator creates a new list:

>>> t1 = [1, 2]
>>> t2 = t1.append(3)
>>> print t1
[1, 2, 3]
>>> print t2
None
>>> t3 = t1 + [3]

>>> t2 is t3
False
